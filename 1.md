# How does the internet work?
<p>The Internet is a network of networks. That are all connected
</p>

# What do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do?
<p>HTML, CSS & JavaScript are all coding languages computers use to present, style, and command a document's data. They are an essential linguistic system that makes it possible for humans to relate easily to computers. While also making it possible for computers to communicate whith one another.</p>

# What is the differnece between backend and frontend?
<p>The difference between backend and frontend is that frontend is anything and everything visual that a user comes in contact with. Its all the content and styles. Backend is considered the server-side part of an application.Its the hidden inner workings and the behind-the-scenes processes in a web application.

# What do the HTTP Status Codes represent? 
<p> HTTP status codes indicate weather a request sent from browser to the web server was successful or unsuccessful. Usually users may not see these codes in the browers, but status codes are returened to the client in HTTP headers each time the web communicates with the server. 
</p>

# What are the Primary HTTP Verbs and what do they mean?
<p> The Primary Verbs are GET, POST, PUT & DELETE. Get means to read something. Post means to create somthing. Put means to updated or edit something. Delete means to detroy or get rid of something.

# What is Big O Notation?
<p> Big O notation is the language used for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run (time complexity). Big O notation can express the best,worst, and average-case running time of an alogrithm 
</p>

# Contrast Big O with Omega and Theta.
<p> The difference between Big O, Omega and Theta is that Big O is the upper bound on an algorithm is the most time required (the worst case performance). Where as Omega is lower bound on an algorithm and is the least amount of time required ( the most efficient way possible, and the best case performance). Lastly, Theta is the tightest bound on an algorithm, which is the worst case times that an algorithm can take (least effeicient case performace out of all).

# Example's of Linear Time Complexity and Quadratic
Time Complexity.

# Linear Time Complexity Ex.

<p>
function findMax(n) {
    let max;
    let counter = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i ++) {
        counter++;
        if(max === undefinded || max < n[i]) {
            max = n[i];
        }
    }

    console.log(`n: ${n.length}, counter: ${counter}`);
    return max;
}
</p>

# Quadratic Time Complexity Ex.
<p>
function hasDuplicates(n) {
    const duplicates = [];
    let counter = 0; 
    for (let outter = 0; outter < n.length; outter++) {
        for (let inner = 0; inner < n.length; inner++) {
            counter++; 

            if(outter === inner) continue;
            
            if(n[outter] === n[inner]) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    console.log(`n: ${n.length}, counter: ${counter}`);
    return false;
